1. When a user clicks search, a qwerty keyboard should appear to allow them to type a search. 
2. If a user clicks the back button, the data should presist.
3. When a user clicks a Player's name more information should become available.
4. Information should remain constant on the player profile page, no matter where a user clicks from.
5. A search for Guards should result in four current players who are listed as Guards being listed.
6. A search for Forward should result in the 6 forwards on the roster being presented. 
7. A search for Integers should function based on rookie year. 
8. Starters should be able to be presented on their own list, which can be clicked through to a detail page.
